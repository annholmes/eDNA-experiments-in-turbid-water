Biological_rep,"1L bottle: replicate A, C or C"
qPCR_rep,qPCR reaction
Detection,"delta smelt eDNA detected: 1, yes; 0, no"
Cq,Cq value of qPCR reaction
Copies,eDNA copies calculated using Cq value and standard curve
Copies_plus,Copies + 0.1 so that all log values are defined
Log_copiesplus,Log of (Copies + 0.1)
Log_copiesplus_1,1 + Log of (Copies + 0.1) so that non-detects have a value of 0 and not -1
Ave_Cq,Avergae Cq for all qPCR replicates that produced a Cq value; does not include non-detects
Ave_copies,Avergae copies including non-detects
Log_ave_copies,Avergae copies including non-detects
